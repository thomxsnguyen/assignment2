    Happy Birthday ÏïÑÏ§åÎßà!
    <br />
    <br />
    We've known each other too long to the point that I can't afford falling out
    of your good graces in fear that you'll expose my stupidity to others. My
    peace offering for the year is my continued, amazing friendship and $20 that
    you will receive on May 18. Besides that, thanks for always being a chiller
    & for introducing me to Thomas. Hope you have a good birthday!
